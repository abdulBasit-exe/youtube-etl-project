#  YouTube Data Engineering Project using AWS (My First AWS end to end Project)

##  Introduction

This is my first hands-on data engineering project using AWS tools and services. I followed along with a tutorial and successfully replicated the entire pipeline to manage and analyze YouTube trending videos data. The project helped me understand how to design and implement a scalable data pipeline on the cloud using services like AWS Glue, S3, Athena, and QuickSight.

Through this experience, I learned a lot about the AWS ecosystem, setting up ETL workflows, using crawlers, and building visualizations‚Äîall while handling real-world semi-structured data.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Services Used
- **Amazon S3**
- **AWS IAM**
- **AWS Lambda**
- **AWS Glue**
- **AWS Athena**
- **Amazon QuickSight**


## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Used

I used the **YouTube Trending Videos Dataset** available on Kaggle:

##  Key Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Downloaded YouTube trending CSVs from Kaggle and uploaded them to S3 (`youtube/raw_statistics/`).

2. **Glue Crawler**  
   - Configured a Glue Crawler to catalog the raw data from S3 for querying with Athena.

3. **AWS Lambda**  
   - Used Lambda to clean data and ETL Job triggers.

4. **Glue ETL Job**  
   - Created a PySpark Glue Job to read raw data, filter by region (`us`, `gb`, `ca`), clean it, and write Parquet files partitioned by `region` to S3.

5. **Athena Querying**  
   - Queried transformed data using SQL in Athena to validate and explore insights.

6. **QuickSight Dashboard**  
   - Built visualizations showing top videos, category performance, and engagement trends.
